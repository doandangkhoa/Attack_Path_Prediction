# Project: Hybrid Dijkstra + Machine Learning for Attack Path Prediction

## Objective

Build a simulation system that:

* Uses **Dijkstra** to generate candidate attack paths.
* Uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** to predict the most likely attack path.

The system will:

1. Generate simulated attack path data.
2. Train a prediction model.
3. Compare results with traditional Dijkstra paths.
